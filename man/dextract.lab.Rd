\title{Extract a subset of data from a trackdata object}
\usage{
dextract.lab(dataset, labs, labtype = unique(labs))
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A trackdata object returned from \code{track}.}

\item{labs}{A vector of labels parallel to \code{trackdata$index}, i.e. one
for each segment in the trackdata.}

\item{labtype}{A vector of labels for which data is to be extracted.}
}
\value{
A trackdata object which is a subset of \code{trackdata} containing
only the data for those labels in \code{labtype}.  The result has the same
components as the input \code{trackdata}:

\item{data}{ A vector or matrix of numerical data. } \item{index}{ A two
column matrix giving the start and end indeces into the data vector for
each segment. } \item{ftime}{ A two column matrix giving the start and end
times for each segment. }
}
\description{
Extract a subset of data from a trackdata object according to the label in
the parallel label vector.
