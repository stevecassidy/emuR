\title{Calculate the coefficients of a parabola}
\usage{
plafit(wav, fit = FALSE, n = 101)
}
\arguments{
\item{wav}{a vector or single column matrix of numeric values to which the
2nd order polynomial is to be fitted.}

\item{fit}{if F, return the coefficients of the polynomial; if T, the
values of the polynomial are returned to the same length as the vector wav.}

\item{n}{in fitting the polynomial, linear time normalisation is first
applied to the input vector wav to 101 points. The polynomial is fitted
under the assumption that these points extend linearly in time between t =
-1 and t = 1 with t = 0 occurring at the temporal midpoint.}
}
\value{
The function returns the coefficients of c0, c1, c2 in the parabola
y = c0 + c1t + c2t\eqn{\mbox{\textasciicircum}}{^}2 where t extends between
-1 and 1. The function can also be used to derive the values of the
parabola as a function of time from the coefficients.
}
\description{
Fit a second ordered polynomial to a vector of values
}
\details{
The function fits a parabola (2nd order polynomial) following the method of
van Bergem, Speech Communication, 14, 1994, 143-162. The algorithm fixes
the parabola at the onset, midpoint, and offset of the vector i.e. such
htat the fitted parabola and original vector have the same values at these
points.
}
\examples{

# fit a polynomial to a segment of fundamental frequency data
plafit(vowlax.fund[1,]$data)

# return the fitted values of the polynomial
plafit(vowlax.fund[1,]$data, fit=TRUE)
