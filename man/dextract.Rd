\title{Extract a subset of data from a trackdata object}
\usage{
dextract(dataset, start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A trackdata object}

\item{start}{A single valued numeric vector corresponding to a proportional
time between zero (the onset of the trackdata) and one (the offset of the
trackdata).}

\item{end}{As start, but optional}
}
\value{
If both start and end are specified, a trackdata object is
returned, otherwise a vector if the original trackdata is one-dimensional
and the end argument is not used, or a matrix if the original trackdata has
more than one dimension and the end argument is not used
}
\description{
A function that cuts up trackdata either at a proportional time or
proportionally between two times. It is a subsidiary function of dplot()
}
\examples{

data(demo.vowels.f0)
data(demo.vowels.fm)

form = demo.vowels.fm
# get the formants at the midpoint: f50 is a matrix
# same as dcut(form, .5, prop=TRUE)
f50 = dextract(form, 0.5)
# get the formants between the 25\% and 75\% time points
# fcut is a trackdata object
# same as dcut(form, .25, .75, prop=TRUE)
fcut = dextract(form, 0.25, 0.75)
# get  F0 at the midpoint. fzero50 is a vector
# same as dcut(fzero, .5, prop=TRUE)
fzero = demo.vowels.f0
fzero50 = dextract(fzero, 0.5)
