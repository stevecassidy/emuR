\title{Function for specifying color, linetype, and line-widths in EMU plotting
functions.}
\usage{
mu.colour(labs, col = TRUE, linetype = FALSE, lwd = NULL, pch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{labs}{A vector of character labels}

\item{col}{A code passed to the 'col' argument in plotting functions. There
are four possibilities. Either logical, a character vector, or a numeric
vector.  In the first case, if TRUE, then a different numeric code is given
for each unique label type. For example, if labs is c("a", "b", "a", "c"),
then the output is c(1, 2, 1, 3). If F, then for this example, the output
is c(1, 1, 1, 1). In the second case, the character vector can be either a
single element specifying a character, or there can be as many elements as
there are unique colors. Thus if col = "red", then for the example c("a",
"b", "a", "c"), the output is c("red", "red", "red", "red"). Alternatively,
since there are three unique labels for this example, then the user could
specify col = c("green", "red", "blue") and the output is c("green", "red",
"green", "blue") if labs is c("a", "b", "a", "c").  In the third case,
'col'. can be either a single element numeric vector, or its length must be
equal to the number of unique types in labs.  For example, if col=3 and if
labs = c("a", "b", "a", "c"), then the output is c(3, 3, 3, 3).
Alternatively, if col = c(2,3,1), then the output is c(2, 3, 2, 1) for the
same example. Finally, col can be specified as a character or numeric
vector that is the same length as labs, allowing the user to choose the
color in which each line should be drawn.  The default is col = TRUE.}

\item{linetype}{A code specifying linetypes, i.e. the values passed to lty
in plotting functions.There are 2 possibilities.  Either logical, a
character vector, or a numeric vector.  In the first case, if TRUE, then a
different numeric code is given for each unique label type. For example, if
labs is c("a", "b", "a", "c"), then the output is c(1, 2, 1, 3). If F, then
for this example, the output is c(1, 1, 1, 1).  In the second case,
'linetype' can be either a single element numeric vector, or its length
must be equal to the number of unique types in labs.  For example, if
linetype=3 and if labs = c("a", "b", "a", "c"), then the output is c(3, 3,
3, 3). Alternatively, if linetype = c(2,3,1), then the output is c(2, 3, 2,
1) for the same example. Finally, linetype can be specified as a numeric
vector that is the same length as labs, allowing the user to choose the
linetype in which each line should be drawn.  The default is linetype=F}

\item{lwd}{A code passed to the lwd argument in plotting functions.  'lwd'
can be either a single element numeric vector, or its length must be equal
to the number of unique types in labs.  For example, if lwd=3 and if labs =
c("a", "b", "a", "c"), then the output is c(3, 3, 3, 3). Alternatively, if
lwd = c(2,3,1), then the output is c(2, 3, 2, 1) for the same example. The
default is NULL in which case all lines are drawn with lwd=1}

\item{pch}{A code passed to the pch argument in plotting functions.
Functions in the same way as lwd above}
}
\value{
If it is a LISTRUE, use \item{colour}{A code for the color'}
\item{linetype}{A code for the linetype} \item{lwd}{A code for the line
width} \item{legend}{A list consisting of \$legend\$lab, \$legend\$lty and
\$legend\$lwd that specify the parameters for the 'legend' function.

...  }
}
\description{
The function specifies color, linetype and linewidths in EMU plotting
functions as is used mostly in calls from within plot.trackdata,
plot.spectral, eplot, and dplot
}
\details{
Parameters are also supplied for use with the function 'legend'
}
\examples{

# examples will be given using the above functions
# b/w but with different linetypes
eplot(vowlax.fdat.5[,1:2], vowlax.l, col=FALSE, lty=TRUE)

# user-defined colors
eplot(vowlax.fdat.5[,1:2], vowlax.l, col=c("green", "blue", "red", "orange"))

# spectral plot, user-defined colors, the last one is dotted
# and with a line-thickness of 2
plot(vowlax.dft.5[1:20,], vowlax.l[1:20], 
col=c("green", "blue", "red", "orange"), 
fun=mean, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 2), lwd=c(1, 1, 1, 2))

# similar but using dplot()
dplot(vowlax.fdat[1:20,2], vowlax.l, 
col=c("green", "blue", "red", "orange"), 
lwd=c(1, 1, 1, 2), lty=c(1, 1, 1, 2))

# the default except plot everything with a dotted line and plotting symbol 4
dplot(vowlax.fdat[,2], vowlax.l, average=TRUE, lty=2, pch=4, type="b", xlim=c(40, 60))

# the default except plot everything with a dotted line and
# with double line thickness
eplot(vowlax.fdat.5[,1:2], vowlax.l, lty=2, lwd=2)
