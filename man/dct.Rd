\title{Discrete Cosine Transformation}
\usage{
dct(data, m = NULL, fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a vector or single column matrix of numeric values to which the
2nd order polynomial is to be fitted.}

\item{m}{The number of DCT coefficients that are returned or on which the
smoothed trajectory is based. Defaults to NULL which returns coefficients
of frequencies k = 0, 1,2 .. N-1 where N is the length of the input signal,
wav. If fit = TRUE and k = NULL, then the the sum of all the cosine waves
whose amplitudes are the DCT coefficients are returned - which is equal to
the original signal. k must be between 2 and the length of the signal.}

\item{fit}{if F, return the DCT coefficients; if T, the values of the
smoothed trajectory are returned based on summing the cosine waves of the k
lowest ordered DCT coefficients, where k is the argument given below.}

\description{
Obtain the coefficients of the discrete cosine transformation (DCTRUE).

\details{
The function calculates the DCT coefficients for any vector or
single-columned matrix. The function can also be used to obtain a smoothed
trajectory of the input data by summing the cosine waves derived from the
first few DCT coefficients.

The algorithm first reflects the input signal about the last data point, N.
Thus if the input signal vec if of length N, the algorithm creates a vector
c(vec, rev(vec[-c(1,N)])). and the R fft function is applied to this
reflected signal. The DCT coefficients are real part of what is returned by
fft i.e.  the amplitudes of the cosine waves of frequencies k = 0, 1, 2,
...2 *(N-1) radians per sample. The phase is zero in all cases. The
amplitudes are calculated in such a way such that if these cosine waves are
summed, the original (reflected) signal is reconstructed. What is returned
by dct() are the amplitudes of the cosine waves (DCT coefficients) up to a
frequency of N radians/sample, i.e. a vector of cosine wave amplitudes that
has the same length as the original signal and of frequencies k = 0, 1, 2,
... (N-1).  Alternatively, if fit=T, a smoothed signal of the same length
as the original signal is obtained based on a summation of the lowest
ordered DCT coefficients. This dct() algorithm returns very similar values
to DCT() with inv=F written by Catherine Watson and used in Watson &
Harrington (1999).
