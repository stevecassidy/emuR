\title{Function to extract a vector or matrix from EMU-Trackdata at a single time
point of to create another EMU-trackdata object between two times.}
\usage{
dcut(
  trackdata,
  left.time,
  right.time,
  single = TRUE,
  average = TRUE,
  prop = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trackdata}{An Emu trackdata object.}

\item{left.time}{Either: a numeric vector of the same length as there are
observations in trackdata. Or: a single value between 0 and 1. In the first
case, the left time boundary of trackdata[n,] is cut at left.time[n], in
the second case, and if prop=T, it is cut at that proportional time.}

\item{right.time}{Either: a numeric vector of the same length as there are
observations in trackdata. Or: a single value between 0 and 1. In the first
case, the right time boundary of trackdata[n,] is cut at right.time[n], in
the second case, and if prop=T, it is cut at that proportional time.}

\item{single}{If TRUE, one value is returned per segment. This applies when
the requested time falls between two track frames. When single=TRUE, the
preceding value is returned, unless average=TRUE (see below), in which case
the average value of the two frames is returned. when the right.time
argument is omitted}

\item{average}{A single element logical vector - see single above. Applies
only when the right.times argument is omitted and when single = TRUE}

\item{prop}{If TRUE left.time and right.time are interpreted as
proportions, if FALSE, they are interpreted as millisecond times}
}
\value{
A trackdata object if both 'left.time' and 'right.time' are
specified, otherwise a matrix if 'right.time' is unspecified and the
trackdata object has multiple columns of data or a vector if right.time' is
unspecified and the trackdata object has a single column of data.
}
\description{
A general purpose tool for extracting data from track objects either at a
particular time, or between two times. The times can be values in
milliseconds or proportional times between zero (the onset) and one (the
offset).
}
\details{
This function extracts data from each segment of a trackdata object.

If 'prop=FALSE' the time arguments ('left.time' and 'right.time') are
interpreted as millisecond times and each should be a vector with the same
length as the number of segments in 'trackdata'.  If 'prop=TRUE' the time
arguments should be single values between zero (the onset of the segment)
and one (the offset).

If 'right.time' is omitted then a single data point corresponding to
'left.time' for each segment is returned.

\examples{

     # the data values of the trackdata object at the temporal midpoint
     # (midvals is matrix of F1 and F2 data)
     dip.fdat[1:10]
     midvals <- dcut(dip.fdat, 0.5, prop=TRUE)
     midvals[1:10,]
     
     
     # the data values of the trackdata object between 
     # extending from 20
     # (bet is a trackdata object of F1 and F2 values)
     bet <- dcut(dip.fdat, 0.2, 0.8, prop=TRUE)
     bet[1]
     

     # the data values of the trackdata object at 30 ms after
     # the start time of the trackdata object
     # (time30 is a matrix of F1 and F2 data
     times <- dip.fdat$ftime[,1]+30
     times[1:10]
     time30 <- dcut(dip.fdat, times)
     time30[1:10]
     

     # the data values of the trackdata object 
     # between the  start time and 30 ms after the start  time
     # (int is a trackdata object of F1 and F2 values extending
     # from the start of the diphthongs up to 30 ms after the diphthongs)
     int <- dcut(dip.fdat, dip.fdat$ftime[,1], times)
     int[1]
