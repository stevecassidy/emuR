* better error message in BPF parser
* `convert_legacyEmuDB()` automatically converts `.ssd` media files to `.wav` and normalizes the annotations to start at 0 (only if attr(ssd,'startTime') is not 0).
* added `sort()` S3 method for `emuRsegs` objects
* checking for badly sorted `emuRsegs` in `requery_hier()` and `requery_seq()` functions
* `create_emuRtrackdata()` returns a simple `data.frame` object not a `data.table` object

* added `browser` argument to `serve()` function which is passed on to `utils::browseURL()` function
* `requery_seq()` now uses `start_item_seq_idx` and `end_item_seq_idx` of seglist instead of `start_item_id` and `start_item_id` to simplify function

* prechecking if attribute definition is already defined (closes \#182)
* `get_trackdata()` now uses temporary SQL tables to store the intermediate results (massive performance gains!). Removed `nrOfAllocationRows` parameter as this is no longer needed as no matrix is used to store the intermediate results. (also closes \#125)

* fixed bad `seq_start_seq_idx` returned by internal `query_databaseHier()` function
* fixed bad sorting of `requery_seq()/requery_hier()` when `calcTimes = F` (still sorted by `start_sample` instead of the correct `seq_idx`)
* added `readr::parse_character()` to data received in `serve()` as this is recoded in windows (fixes \#188).
