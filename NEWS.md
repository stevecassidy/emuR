# emuR 0.1.8.9000

## bug fixes

* fixed error handling of create_emuRtrackdata + added @export to roxygen doc
* invalid annotJSONs generated by import_mediaFiles fixed
* convert_TextGridCollection can now handle nested folders again
* invalid UUIDs in DBConfig produced by convert_BPFCollection. Also added additional unit test to detect this.

## new features / performance tweaks / improvements

* get_trackdata with onTheFly calculation now reuses AsspDataObj if the current utterance is the same as the previous (large performance gain especially on long audio files)
* checking if DBconfig exists for better error message if 'name' field is not set correctly in DBconfig
* setting PRAGMA temp_store = 2; for SQLite connections
* not extracting tables to R if no regex needed to create filtered_tmp tables (performance gain when querying large emuDBs)
* convert_BPFCollection can now assigns the same label to more than one item when unifying tiers

# emuR 0.1.7

* R depends version bump to 3.2.0 (as requested by CRAN maintainer)
* updated testthat::expect\_less\_than to expect\_lt calls (due to deprecated warnings)

* removed legacy version of EQL vignette (overlooked as inst/doc was in .gitignore)

# emuR 0.1.6

* skipping in-depth thorough tests on CRAN for query and autobuild SQL functions 

# emuR 0.1.5

* fixed problem of interm\_res\_tables already being present with queries that have multiple recursion depth on both sides
of either -> or ^ operand (e.g. query (ae ,  "[[[Phonetic = n -> Phonetic =z] -> Phonetic = S ] ^ [Text = friends -> Text = she]]")) 
* fixed bad URL in README.md

* file locking problem that caused vignettes to fail under windows problem fixed

# emuR 0.1.0.9000

* massive refactor of all functions that used to refer to an emuDB by

  that is now returned by the `load_emuDB()` function.
