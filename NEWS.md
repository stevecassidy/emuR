# emuR 1.1.0

## new features / performance tweaks / improvements

* URL encoding of bundle and session names to allow for URL string reserved characters in bundle and session names
* error message of `get_trackdata()` now contains seglist row index if "Can not extract following"
* `normalize_length()` now allows for additional non-numeric columns
* changed `stop()` to `warning()` in `get_trackdata()` when samplerates are inconsistent (closes \#190)
* better error message when there is a naming mismatch of `_emuDB` dir `_DBconfig.json`
* using `sub()` instead of `tools::file_path_sans_ext()` to handle `_` in file extensions
* `query()`, `requery_seq()` and `requery_hier()` now supports the `resultType` `"tibble"` (and `get_trackdata()`, `requery_seq()`, `requery_hier()` and `serve()` support them as input)
* `serve()` function now uses `seglist$start` and  `seglist$end` instead of `seglist$sample_start` and `seglist$sample_end`
* implemented first version of `update_itemsInLevel()` (only label updates for now)
* now setting the `sample_start` and `sample_end` values in query results when EVENT levels are queried (previously only `start` was set)
* implemented first versions of `create_links()` (currently not checking for anything), `create_itemsInLevel()` (only EVENTs and ITEMs) and `update_itemsInLevel()` (only labels) and `delete_itemsInLevel()`
* `list_bundles()` outside of loop for performance bump in `get_trackdata()`
* better error message in `add_files()` if no files are found
* `consistentOutputType` of `get_trackdata()` is not set to `TRUE` and is reset to `T` if `resultType` is `"emuRtrackdata"` or `"tibble"` (fixes \#203)
* avoiding negative `times_rel` and `times_norm` values in `create_emuRtrackdata()` by setting them to 0 (caused by string to numeric conversion precision errors)
* `requery_seq()` now inserts NA values for the out of bounds rows instead of dropping them.
* implemented `list_sampleRates()` function
* `get_trackdata()` is now iteratively appending to a `list()` instead of into a SQLite temp table. This is a fairly large performance boost and also fixes \#206.
* added deprecation warnings to vignettes (added links to manual chapters)

## bug fixes

* propper fix for "now ordering by `items_idx` not by `start_start_seq_idx` which led to bad label sequences (fixes \#140)"
* fixed bad indexing in `normalize_length()` when sl_rowIdx values are not a `c(1, 2, 3, 4, ...)` sequence
* fixed `staticContours` SSFF tracks not being sent to EMU-webApp (fixes \#195)
* fixed bug with completely empty levels that caused a bad resort of levels in `_annot.json`s in `rewrite_allAnnots()`

* `normalize_length()` now handles various additional column types (not just `"numeric"`)

# emuR 1.0.0

## new features / performance tweaks / improvements

* implemented new `consistentOutputType` parameter for `get_trackdata()` to always return a `trackdata` or `emuRtrackdata` object independent of what the `cut` and `npoints` arguments are set to
* now removing `levelCanvasOrder` entry in `remove_levelDefinition()` (fixes \#156)
* `serve()` method now uses GET to deliver media files to the EMU-webApp. This avoids the base64 conversion overhead and is a quite significant load time improvement
* explicit error message in `convert_legacyEmuDB()` when invalid redundant links are found
* better error message in BPF parser
* `convert_legacyEmuDB()` automatically converts `.ssd` media files to `.wav` and normalizes the annotations to start at 0 (only if attr(ssd,'startTime') is not 0).
* added `sort()` S3 method for `emuRsegs` objects
* checking for badly sorted `emuRsegs` in `requery_hier()` and `requery_seq()` functions
* `create_emuRtrackdata()` returns a simple `data.frame` object not a `data.table` object
* `emuRtrackdata` object now contains a `times_norm` (normalized time values between 0 and 1 for each segment) column by default
* added note to `print.emuRsegs()` to give the user a hint about missing columns
* implemented `print.emuRtrackdata()` to avoid overly verbose output
* implemented `normalize_length()` function as S3 function to normalize the lenght of each segment in an `emuRtrackdata` object
* added `absolute_file_path` column to output of `list_files()`
* query engine does not rely on label index in label array any more (updated `convert_queryResultToEmuRsegs()` to use `resultAttrDef` instead of `labelIdx`). Closes \#164.
* added `browser` argument to `serve()` function which is passed on to `utils::browseURL()` function
* `requery_seq()` now uses `start_item_seq_idx` and `end_item_seq_idx` of seglist instead of `start_item_id` and `start_item_id` to simplify function
* implemented `check_emuDBhandle()` function that is used on every exported function that takes a `emuDBhandle` as an argument to check if the handle is still valid (closes \#176)
* implemented `"tibble"` as `resultType` option in `get_trackdata()`. This will probably replace the `"emuRtrackdata"` option in future (it contains exactly the same data/columns).
* prechecking if attribute definition is already defined (closes \#182)
* `get_trackdata()` now uses temporary SQL tables to store the intermediate results (massive performance gains!). Removed `nrOfAllocationRows` parameter as this is no longer needed as no matrix is used to store the intermediate results. (also closes \#125)
* `convert_TextGridCollectio()` using `dir.exists()` instead of `file.exists()` to check dirs 
* all read operations now use the readr package (avoids encoding problems like \#187)
* `list_attributeDefinitions()` now allows for a name vector to be passed in
* rewrite of `rewrite_allAnnots()` functions for faster rewrites of `_annot.json` files to disk
* improved cleanup in testing DBconfig functions
* now ordering by `items_idx` not by `start_start_seq_idx` which led to bad label sequences (fixes \#140)

## bug fixes

* fixed problem of updating cache. Didn't handle `data.frame` object that was thought to be a vector correctly!
* fixed a bug in the BPF export function, which meant that WAVE files were only copied into one session
* added missing `$` in pattern arguments in `list.files` call in `list_files` (fixes \#170)
* not adding ssffTrackDefinition to DBconfig if user input is no (closes \#171)
* fixed bad `seq_start_seq_idx` and `seq_seq_idx` returned by `requery_seq()` (fixes \#183) 
* fixed bad `seq_start_seq_idx` returned by internal `query_databaseHier()` function
* fixed bad sorting of `requery_seq()/requery_hier()` when `calcTimes = F` (still sorted by `start_sample` instead of the correct `seq_idx`)
* added `readr::parse_character()` to data received in `serve()` as this is recoded in windows (fixes \#188).
